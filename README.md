MLSNet folder is for the original MLSnetwork work published as Enforcing Multilevel Security Policies in Unstable Networks 

mMLSnet folder is for the simulation for mobile MLSnet in MILCOM2023

in MLSnet folder, we only provides 4 gml files, more topologies can be found in sndlib website. Slight revision on the original gml file may be needed as the graph may contain self-loop, multiedges and edges with the same tags.

for any questions, please contact Mingli Yu email: mxy309@psu.edu
